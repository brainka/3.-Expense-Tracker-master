# 3.-Expense-Tracker

Created a simple expense tracker.

There is no use of local storage, therefore the list resets to empty once the page is refreshed.

You can add an expense if all the fields are populated and the amount has to be in the format of $1 or $1.00.

To remove an expense item, you simply hover over the item and double click to remove it.

p.s. please don't judge the css lol
